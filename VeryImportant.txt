	-> Time Complexity

				O(logN)  = Good

				O(NlogN) = Bad
				O(N!) , O(c^N) , O(N^c) = Worst

	-> K and smallest/largest -> Heap (kth largest : Min Heap & kth Smallest : Max Heap)

		priority_queue<int> maxheap;

		Max Priority queue (Or Max heap) ordered by first element

	-> Sorted -> Binary Search
